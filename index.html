        Late Goodbye
        lyrics by Poets of the Fall

        In our headlights
        Staring, bleak
        Beer cans
        Deer's eyes

        On the asphalt
        Underneath
        Our crushed plans
        And my lies

        Lonely street signs
        Power lines

        They keep on flashing
        Flashing by

        And we keep driving into the night
        It's a late goodbye
        Such a late goodbye
        And we keep driving into the night
        It's a late goodbye

        Your breath
        Hot upon my cheek
        And we crossed
        That line

        You made me strong
        When I was feeling weak
        And we crossed
        That one time

        Screaming stop signs
        Staring wild eyes

        Keep on flashing
        Flashing by

        And we keep driving into the night
        It's a late goodbye
        Such a late goodbye
        And we keep driving into the night
        It's a late goodbye



        I didn't want to
        remember this part

        Leaving him was
        simply too hard

        Let it be, Cole.

        It's a late goodbye
        Such a late goodbye

        And we keep driving into the night
        It's a late goodbye

        -->
